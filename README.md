# TravelAdviorAiagent
 Travel Advisor Agent using GPT & LangGraph
📌 Project Overview
This project is a Travel Advisor Agent built using OpenAI's GPT model and orchestrated using LangGraph, a powerful graph-based framework for managing multi-agent workflows and tool integrations.

The application allows users to receive intelligent, context-aware travel advice and itinerary recommendations via natural language queries. Powered by the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), the Travel Advisor leverages LangGraph for tool usage, conversation flow management, and memory handling, ensuring a scalable and modular agent architecture.

🚀 Features
🧠 GPT-Powered Natural Language Understanding

🌍 Real-time Travel Recommendations

🔁 Memory-enabled Conversations via LangGraph

🔧 Tool Integration with External APIs (e.g., for flights, hotels, maps if added)

🗺️ Custom Travel Itinerary Generation

🧩 Composable Agent Architecture using LangGraph

📚 Well-structured and modular codebase

🛠️ Tech Stack
Tech	Description
OpenAI GPT	For natural language understanding and generating responses
LangGraph	To define and manage conversation flow as a graph
LangChain	For prompt templates, tools, memory, and agent building
Python	Core language used for building the application
Jupyter Notebook / Script	Development and experimentation

🧩 LangGraph Design
The project uses LangGraph to build a stateful agent that can:

Maintain conversation memory

Call tools (e.g., search tools, booking APIs)

Manage multi-step interactions

React intelligently based on prior user inputs

LangGraph allows defining the agent workflow as a directed graph, where:

Nodes are actions (e.g., generating a response, calling a tool)

Edges define flow logic depending on outcomes or inputs

States hold intermediate memory and context

The graph.yaml or LangGraph configuration in the repo details how each component interacts, enabling full traceability and modularity.

📘 LangGraph Integration

Docs Included: See /langgraph_docs/ folder for:

Graph definition

Node behaviors

Tool wiring

Example flows and test cases

LangGraph helps structure complex agent workflows using the graph-based paradigm, which is superior for branching logic, loops, and multi-tool orchestration compared to basic sequential prompts.

🎯 Use Case Examples
“Plan a 7-day trip to Italy for me.”

“Find the cheapest flights from London to Tokyo in June.”

“Suggest vegetarian food spots in Bangkok with reviews.”

“Can you add a hiking day to my current itinerary?”

📌 Future Enhancements
Integration with live booking APIs (Skyscanner, Booking.com)

Custom user profile support

UI using Streamlit or React

Multilingual support

Travel cost estimation tool
